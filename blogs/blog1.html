    <p class="mb-10 text-xl">
      Professor Gaku Yoneda, the last of the God candidates to be revealed in one of the greatest works of literature and art – Platinum End, was by far, in my personal opinion, the most enigmatic and simplest character in the entire series. The words spoken by him, the values he held on to - until his death, are the only ‘rays’ we can call ‘hope’.<br>
      <br>Let’s rewind back to the age of early ancies (fancy word ;)…
      <br>Dudes sat all day, naked, daydreaming on the highest rock in the forest, with absolutely 0 aim about their future (origin of Omegle), and then one fine 11:45am, they suddenly realised they had to kill some animals to feed their family. Oh no, the thought of family has already arrived (a moment of silence pls). On the other hand, girls used to be like “work out yo a** little kiddo, why did I even birth you for duh.” The point I’m trying to prove is you’ve read it completely wrong in your history books. Early humans who worked were children, early “parents” never worked. Well, it’s the opposite now *pff Dark Humour Intensifies*<br>
      <br>These early people discovered fire, right? Even if that statement is under sus, we can’t help but hold on to it for the time being. If the first person who lit fire never thought of believing in the process he would be executing in the future to light something called “fire”, he would never have done it in the first place.<br><br>
      <strong>Yoneda definitely tells us one absolute truth, a truth which is so true, that the Mother of Truths “Everything is Energy” could soon, in a few years, stoop below this one –</strong><br><br>
      If there’s an event occurring in a particular segment of a timeline tunnel compromised with several entangled time zones, the event can have even more than twice the number of worldlines in the tunnel. How crazy are we, humans; we’ve managed to rip through all of these unknown physical quantities and measurements, and landed at one single checkpoint – either the event happens or it doesn’t. Thus, every event in the Universe can have two outcomes. However, the problem is – whether we can even question the happenstance of the event.<br><br>
      To solve the problem, let’s take a little detour (no, I won’t be talking about Dua Lipa all of a sudden). Well, you see, reader-san, human brain is divided into 2 states of itself – Faith and Reason. All the other states like Memory and Processing, etc. are derived states from the basic ones. Well, every scientific fact has an exception to it. In this case, it’s one state of mind that arises from none, the one state of mind we have all held dear to or are holding dear to, for accomplishing our goals. A simple 7-letter word, or so they say – B-E-L-I-E-F. Belief. When you believe in someone, you just believe in them, you don’t have faith that one day they might fulfil that goal; you don’t check to reason with the situation whether they can even afford to achieve that goal. You just believe in them. Belief is the only blind state of (not our brain), but our MIND.<br><br>
      So, you see, right? It’s pretty simple. We’ve been trained for generations to believe in someone/something and, most importantly in the word itself, and it’s so absolute a fact, that we, indeed have created a new realm with that very belief of ours – The Human Mind. Mind is not the sister of brain (man that’d be some cool in***t anime), but thank you for your time, it’s sadly NOT. Whether an event occurs or not, the fact that you BELIEVE in the happenstance of that event proves that the event has a 50% probability of happening or not at the same time. You, a 3D non-observant being, have managed to create an apparently structural superposition of two probabilities of the same event to create that very event.<br><br>
      Not clear enough? Okay, let’s simplify it down – you are viewing an electronic device right now. Okay, so… the way your brain perceives your sight is actually a (kind-of) hypothetical signal from your one and only hypothetical realm in your entire existence, i.e. your mind. But, the way your mind perceives it, is not a single signal from your eyes. Your mind considers 2 probabilities even before your mind cares to consider the very existence of the device. Your mind hallucinates 2 conditions of the same existence – either the device exists, or it doesn’t, and it superpositions these 2 probabilities into one single phenomenon we call existence. That’s precisely how you should be perceiving your electronic device (maybe mobile or pc) right now.<br><br>
      You could probably do a little experiment to get a half-a**ed proof of this. Sit on a chair, confronting a table. Keep an object diagonally towards your right side. Turn your face 90 degrees to the left. Try closing your right eye and seeing it with your left eye, will you see the object? Nope. Try closing your left eye and you can easily see it with the right eye. So, you’re basically analysing the data from both processes and coming to a conclusion that the object exists. So, it’s safe to consider at this point that whatever we see is not the existence itself, but a superposition of the facts that it could/couldn’t exist at the same time. All I’m trying to say is – we don’t witness existence, we give birth to an existence.<br><br>
      What Professor Yoneda tried to explain to us is figuratively – What we believe can save the world, what we believe can keep us happy, doesn’t basically need to act at all to do any of that, and hasn’t clearly done it in millions of years, although that doesn’t prove the creature doesn’t exist. The question is – how are we so sure to even question its existence? Well, those who have faith in the creature are as good as undead monsters. Those who believe in the creature, may/may not contribute something to its existence because believing in something’s existence doesn’t necessarily mean it would exist, however the fact that someone believes in the creature is an unbreakable universal truth. Those who do not believe in the creature, have a belief strong enough to contradict someone else’s belief, however the fact that both of them believe in their own ideals is again an unencrypted universal truth.<br><br>
      The conception among scientists that assumptions, hypotheses, theories mean nothing until they’re proven, is a conception in itself. Even if that little assumption means something, the fact that someone believes in it, is a point so strong that none of the sciences in the future can possibly break it. Think about it this way, if we’ve been capable enough to believe in the word “belief” for hundreds of thousands of years now, couldn't we probably decipher this masterpiece of a show with the same truth?
      <br><br><strong>Who is God? Who created it? What is this creature? The answer doesn't lie in our past/present/future. Interesting enough for a certain fact, haven't we been desperately trying to find an answer? Haven't you ever confronted this second thought that we've been way too desperate to find an answer? Why...?</strong>
